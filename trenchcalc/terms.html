    </div>

    <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span> Purpose of the App</h2>

      <li><strong>This software is a tool, not a replacement for licensed professional engineering judgment</strong></li>
      <li>Results must be verified by qualified engineers before use in construction projects</li>
      <li>Compliance with local construction and engineering software regulations is your responsibility</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <p>
        <strong>CRITICAL:</strong> For safety-critical construction decisions, you must rely on licensed professional engineers and verified engineering calculations.
