  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p><strong>TrenchCalc</strong> values your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights as a user.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We collect the following types of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When you sign in, we use Firebase Authentication (Google) to securely manage your login. You can create an account using your email address, Apple Sign In, or Google Sign In.</li>
    <li><strong>LiDAR Scans:</strong> If you use LiDAR scanning features, scan data is processed locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Information:</strong> Project details, calculations, and site data are stored locally on your device. This data is not uploaded to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> If you enable weather advisories, the app may access your device's location to provide relevant site information. Location data is not stored or shared.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> Subscription purchase information is processed through Apple App Store and Google Play. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous interaction data (such as app launches, crash reports, and performance metrics) to improve stability and features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="third-party-ai-services">Third-Party AI Services</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> If you use the Site Diary feature, your voice transcriptions and text prompts are sent to third-party AI service providers for processing.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What Data is Sent to Third-Party AI Services</h3>
  <p>When you use the Site Diary feature, the following data is transmitted to third-party AI service providers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice Transcripts:</strong> Your voice recordings are first transcribed by a third-party speech-to-text service, then the transcriptions are sent to a third-party AI service for polishing</li>
    <li><strong>Project Information:</strong> Project name, date, and location (if provided)</li>
    <li><strong>User Prompts:</strong> Any text you enter for AI processing, including diary entries and voice transcriptions</li>
    <li><strong>System Prompts:</strong> Instructions for how the AI service should format the output (e.g., "convert to formal construction site diary report")</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>How Third-Party AI Services Use Your Data</h3>
  <p>
    Third-party AI service providers process your data according to their own privacy policies and terms of service. Key points:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> AI services use your prompts to generate AI responses (diary polishing, text enhancement)</li>
    <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> AI service providers may retain your prompts for a limited period (typically up to 30 days) for abuse monitoring and service improvement, unless you opt out</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> By default, AI service providers may use your prompts to train their models. You can opt out of training data usage by contacting us</li>
    <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> AI service providers do not share your prompts with third parties, but they may be reviewed by their staff for safety and quality purposes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Your Options Regarding Third-Party AI Services</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out of Training:</strong> You can opt out of AI service providers using your prompts for model training by contacting us, and we will configure our system to exclude your prompts from training</li>
    <li><strong>No Prompts Stored:</strong> We do not store your prompts or transcripts on our servers after processing</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> All data sent to third-party AI services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS</li>
    <li><strong>You Can Stop Using Site Diary:</strong> You can stop using the Site Diary feature at any time and your data will no longer be sent to third-party AI services</li>
  </ul>
